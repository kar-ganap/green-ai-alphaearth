# Hard Validation Collection: Session Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-23
**Session Goal**: Collect and prepare comprehensive hard validation samples for temporal validation experiments

## Executive Summary

Successfully collected **359 validation samples** (104% of 345 target) across **3 use cases** and **3 years** (2022, 2023, 2024). Implemented scientifically-justified differentiated spatial buffers based on independence mechanisms. Feature extraction in progress for all 359 samples using 70D feature space.

## Key Strategic Decisions

### 1. Differentiated Spatial Buffers

**Decision**: Use case-specific spatial buffers instead of uniform 3km buffer

**Implementation**:
```python
SPATIAL_BUFFERS = {
    'risk_ranking': 3.0,      # Spatial independence primary
    'comprehensive': 3.0,      # Spatial independence primary
    'rapid_response': 1.0,     # Temporal independence primary
    'edge_cases': 1.0          # Feature-space independence primary
}
```

**Scientific Justification**:
- Drift decomposition analysis: 18.6% real change vs 1.3% sampling bias
- 95% of temporal drift is real environmental change
- Minimal spatial autocorrelation contribution
- Use cases with temporal/feature-space independence can use smaller buffers

**Impact**: Enabled rapid_response collection (114 samples collected with 1km buffer)

### 2. rapid_response: Focused Regions Approach

**Problem**: Global tropics sampling with 500x oversampling yielded 0 samples

**Root Cause**: Random sampling across vast area (global tropics) with specific year constraint hit no valid pixels

**Solution**: Changed to focused high-deforestation regions
- **Amazon** (40%): -15° to 5°N, -75° to -45°E
- **DRC** (30%): -5° to 5°N, 15° to 30°E
- **Indonesia** (30%): -5° to 5°N, 95° to 140°E

**Result**: 114 samples collected (152% success rate)

**Reasoning**:
- Concentrates sampling where deforestation is most active
- Maintains geographic diversity across tropical regions
- Balances representativeness with sample availability

### 3. edge_cases: Known Limitation

**Problem**: Unable to collect edge_cases samples with Hansen data

**Root Cause**: Combination of constraints too restrictive:
- Narrow tree cover ranges (e.g., 30-50%)
- Specific loss year requirement
- Small clearing size preference
- Hansen 30m resolution at edge of detectability

**Attempted Solutions**:
1. ✗ Increased oversampling (500x → 1000x)
2. ✗ Widened tree cover ranges (10% → 20%)
3. ✗ **Rejected**: Remove year constraint (would defeat temporal validation)

**User Insight**: "Try alternative approaches for edge_cases (e.g., remove year constraint entirely)? - what does this mean. then there's nothing to validate temporally right?"

**Resolution**: Documented as known limitation. Requires:
- Higher-resolution data (Sentinel-2 10m, Planet 3m)
- Manual curation with verified dates
- Alternative ground truth sources

**Decision**: Proceed with 359 samples from 3 use cases

### 2. Temporal Validation Experiments

Run 4 validation phases using the 359 samples:

**Phase 1: Early generalization (2020-2021 → 2022)**
- Train on 2020-2021 only
- Test on 2022 samples (118 samples)
- Validates early model generalization

**Phase 2: Progressive learning (2020-2022 → 2023)**
- Train on 2020-2022
- Test on 2023 samples (115 samples)
- Validates progressive adaptation

**Phase 3: Held-out year (2020-2021+2023 → 2024)**
- Train on 2020-2021 and 2023 (skip 2022)
- Test on 2024 samples (126 samples)
- Validates gap-year generalization

**Phase 4: Full training (2020-2023 → 2024)**

- Per-use-case performance trends
- Temporal drift patterns across years
- Error analysis for failures

**Deliverables**:
- Validation results summary
- Per-use-case performance breakdown
- Temporal generalization analysis
- Recommendations for production deployment

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Independence Mechanisms Matter

Different use cases have different primary independence mechanisms. Tailoring spatial buffers to the use case improves sample collection while maintaining validation integrity.

### 2. Hansen Data Limitations

Hansen Global Forest Change (30m) has constraints for edge cases:
- Small clearings (<1 hectare) at detectability limit
- Low tree cover (30-50%) near classification threshold
- Year-specific samples rare for edge cases

Higher-resolution data (Sentinel-2, Planet) needed for comprehensive edge case validation.

### 3. Geographic Concentration Works

For use cases with sparse samples (rapid_response), concentrating on high-activity regions is more effective than global random sampling while maintaining representativeness.

### 4. Temporal Constraints Are Non-Negotiable

Removing year constraints to increase sample availability would undermine temporal validation purpose. Better to document limitations than compromise validation integrity.

## Conclusion

Successfully collected and prepared **359 high-quality validation samples** across 3 use cases and 3 years for temporal validation experiments. Made several key strategic decisions with scientific justification:

1. **Differentiated spatial buffers** based on independence mechanisms
2. **Focused regions approach** for rapid_response sampling
3. **Document edge_cases limitation** rather than compromise temporal validation

**Ready for**: Temporal validation experiments (Phases 1-4)

**Timeline**: Feature extraction complete within ~1 hour, validation experiments ready to launch
