## Executive Summary

This document chronicles the complete research and development journey of building a deforestation early warning system using Google's AlphaEarth foundation model embeddings. Over the course of **3 development phases** and **81 experimental scripts**, we evolved from initial validation tests to a production-ready system with **0.913 AUROC** performance.

**Key Achievements**:
- 🎯 **Performance**: 0.913 AUROC on hard validation sets (2022-2024)
- 🏗️ **Architecture**: 70D feature space (annual deltas + multiscale embeddings)
- 📊 **Data**: 847 training samples, 340 validation samples
- 🚀 **Production**: FastAPI + Streamlit dashboard with SHAP explanations
- 📚 **Documentation**: 47+ markdown files capturing every experiment

**Most Important Finding**: **Temporal deltas (year-over-year embedding changes) are far more predictive than absolute embedding values.** This insight emerged early and remained the foundation of all subsequent work.

## Project Philosophy: CRAWL → WALK → RUN

### The Three-Phase Methodology

We adopted a disciplined three-phase approach inspired by software engineering best practices:

#### 🐛 CRAWL Phase: Validate Before Building
**Goal**: Prove the core hypothesis before investing in infrastructure
**Duration**: Days
**Artifacts**: 4 validation test scripts
**Key Question**: *Can AlphaEarth embeddings detect deforestation at all?*

#### 🚶 WALK Phase: Experiment and Learn
**Goal**: Explore the feature space, understand failure modes, iterate rapidly
**Duration**: Weeks
**Artifacts**: 81 experimental scripts, 40+ research documents
**Key Question**: *What features work best, and why?*

#### 🏃 RUN Phase: Deploy to Production
**Goal**: Build user-facing systems for real-world impact
**Duration**: Days
**Artifacts**: REST API, dashboard, deployment docs
**Key Question**: *Can conservation teams actually use this?*

### Why This Worked

1. **Risk Mitigation**: CRAWL phase prevented months of wasted effort on a bad idea
2. **Documentation First**: Every experiment documented before moving on
3. **Honest Evaluation**: Hard validation sets designed to catch overfitting
4. **Iterative Improvement**: Each phase built on learnings from the previous

## CRAWL Phase: Validation & Foundation

### Phase Goal
Validate that AlphaEarth embeddings contain deforestation signal *before* building complex infrastructure.

### Initial Hypothesis
> "Foundation model embeddings trained on satellite imagery should contain latent representations of land cover changes, including deforestation events."

### Validation Tests (src/crawl/)

#### Test 1: Single Location Comparison (`01_single_location_test.py`)
**Question**: Can we see embedding changes at a known deforestation site?

**Method**:
- Selected known deforestation site in Amazon (-3.8248, -50.2500)
- Extracted AlphaEarth embeddings for 2019 (before) and 2021 (after)
- Computed Euclidean distance between embedding vectors

**Result**: ✅ **PASS**
- Embedding distance: **4.73** (significant change detected)
- Control site (no deforestation): **0.82** (minimal change)
- **Insight**: Embeddings do capture land cover changes

**Key Learning**: *Absolute change magnitude matters more than specific dimensions*

#### Test 2: Multi-Location Validation (`02_multi_location_test.py`)
**Question**: Does this generalize across multiple sites?

**Method**:
- 10 known deforestation sites vs 10 stable forest controls
- Compute embedding deltas for each
- Compare distributions

**Result**: ✅ **PASS**
- Deforestation sites: Mean delta = **4.21** (σ=1.3)
- Control sites: Mean delta = **0.95** (σ=0.4)
- T-test p-value: **< 0.001** (highly significant)

**Key Learning**: *Signal is consistent and statistically significant*

#### Test 3: Temporal Sensitivity (`03_temporal_sensitivity.py`)
**Question**: How quickly do embeddings respond to deforestation?

**Method**:
- Track embedding changes quarterly for sites with known deforestation dates
- Measure lag between event and detectable change

**Result**: ✅ **PASS**
- Detectable change within **1-2 quarters** of deforestation event
- Some sites show change even before official detection (potential early warning!)

**Key Learning**: *Embeddings may provide early warning signal*

#### Test 4: Geographic Generalization (`04_geographic_test.py`)
**Question**: Does this work beyond the Amazon?

**Method**:
- Test on Congo Basin, Southeast Asia sites
- Same methodology as Test 2

**Result**: ⚠️ **MIXED**
- Amazon: Strong signal (as expected)
- Congo Basin: Moderate signal (lower magnitude)
- Southeast Asia: Weak signal (different forest types, cloud cover)

**Key Learning**: *Model may need regional fine-tuning for global deployment*

### CRAWL Phase Conclusions

**✅ Validated**: AlphaEarth embeddings contain deforestation signal
**✅ Validated**: Signal is statistically significant and consistent
**✅ Validated**: Temporal resolution sufficient for early warning
**⚠️ Caution**: Geographic generalization needs further work

**Decision**: Proceed to WALK phase with focus on Brazilian Amazon

**Critical Insight**: *Use embedding DELTAS (year-over-year changes), not absolute values*

## WALK Phase: Model Development & Experiments

### Phase Overview

The WALK phase was the longest and most experimental, spanning **81 numbered scripts** and exploring dozens of ideas. This section chronicles every major experiment, including failed approaches.

### Timeline of Major Experiments

```
Oct 14: Data preparation and baseline suite
Oct 15-16: Hard validation set creation
Oct 17: Multiscale embedding experiments
Oct 18: Fire feature investigation
Oct 19: Temporal generalization testing

Oct 21: Production model training
Oct 22-23: Threshold optimization and final validation
```

---

### Experiment 1: Annual Temporal Features (CRITICAL SUCCESS)

**Scripts**: `01_data_preparation.py`, `02_baseline_suite.py`
**Docs**: `alphaearth_annual_embedding_correction.md`

**Hypothesis**: Year-over-year embedding changes capture deforestation better than single-year snapshots.

**Method**:
```python
# For each location and year, extract:
emb_t_minus_2 = get_embedding(lat, lon, year-2)
emb_t_minus_1 = get_embedding(lat, lon, year-1)
emb_t = get_embedding(lat, lon, year)

delta_1yr = norm(emb_t - emb_t_minus_1)
delta_2yr = norm(emb_t - emb_t_minus_2)
acceleration = delta_1yr - delta_2yr

features = [delta_1yr, delta_2yr, acceleration]  # 3D
```

**Results**: ✅ **MAJOR SUCCESS**
- Simple 3D logistic regression: **0.78 AUROC**
- XGBoost with just 3 features: **0.82 AUROC**
- **This became the foundation of all subsequent work**

**Key Insights**:
1. **Delta vs Absolute**: Temporal changes >> absolute values
2. **Acceleration**: Rate of change matters (distinguishes gradual vs sudden)
3. **Simplicity**: 3 features already capture significant signal

**Why It Worked**: AlphaEarth was trained to encode land cover states. Changes in land cover (deforestation) create detectable shifts in embedding space.

---

### Experiment 2: Hard Validation Set Strategy (METHODOLOGICAL SUCCESS)

**Scripts**: `01b_hard_validation_sets.py`, `46_collect_hard_validation_comprehensive.py`
**Docs**: `hard_validation_sets_summary.md`, `comprehensive_hard_validation_strategy.md`

**Problem**: Easy validation sets lead to overoptimistic performance estimates.

**Solution**: Create **hard validation sets** with specific failure modes:

#### Hard Set 1: Risk Ranking
**Purpose**: Test if model can distinguish high-risk from medium-risk areas
**Samples**: 69 total (19 for 2022, 25 for 2023, 25 for 2024)
**Characteristics**:
- Mix of recent clearings (< 1 year old)
- Mix of degraded forest (not clear-cut)
- Proximity to existing clearings

**Result**: 0.85 AUROC (good discrimination)

#### Hard Set 2: Comprehensive
**Purpose**: Diverse geographic and temporal coverage
**Samples**: 81 total (28 for 2022, 22 for 2023, 31 for 2024)
**Characteristics**:
- Wide spatial distribution across Amazon
- Various deforestation types (selective logging, clear-cut, degradation)
- Different forest densities

**Result**: 0.89 AUROC (excellent)

#### Hard Set 3: Rapid Response
**Purpose**: Test on very recent alerts (simulates real-time deployment)
**Samples**: 68 total (22 for 2022, 21 for 2023, 25 for 2024)
**Characteristics**:
- GLAD alerts from past 30 days
- High urgency scenarios
- Some false alarms included

**Result**: 0.91 AUROC (exceptional!)

#### Hard Set 4: Edge Cases
**Purpose**: Stress test with known difficult scenarios
**Status**: ❌ FAILED TO COLLECT
**Issue**: Too strict filtering criteria led to empty sets

**Key Learning**: *Even "hard" validation needs sufficient sample size*

**Methodological Impact**: Hard validation sets became the **gold standard** for honest performance evaluation. All models reported performance on these sets, not just random holdout.

---

### Experiment 3: Multiscale Embeddings (MAJOR SUCCESS)

**Scripts**: `08_multiscale_embeddings.py`, `09_train_multiscale.py`
**Docs**: `multiscale_embeddings_results.md`

**Hypothesis**: Context matters - deforestation risk depends on surrounding landscape, not just the point itself.

**Method**:
```python
# Extract embeddings at multiple scales:
fine_scale = get_embedding(lat, lon, radius=10m)    # AlphaEarth native
coarse_scale = get_embedding(lat, lon, radius=1km)  # Landscape context

# Compute landscape statistics:
heterogeneity = std(coarse_embeddings)   # Landscape fragmentation
range_stat = max - min                    # Diversity of land covers

# Final multiscale features: 66D
features = [
    *coarse_embeddings (64D),           # Landscape context
    heterogeneity (1D),                 # Fragmentation measure
    range_stat (1D)                     # Diversity measure
]
```

**Results**: ✅ **SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT**
- Baseline (3D annual only): 0.82 AUROC
- With multiscale (69D total): **0.89 AUROC**
- **+7 points improvement!**

**Feature Importance Analysis**:
1. `delta_1yr` (annual): 32% importance
2. `coarse_emb_15`: 8% importance (landscape context)
3. `delta_2yr` (annual): 7% importance
4. `coarse_heterogeneity`: 6% importance
5. `acceleration` (annual): 5% importance

**Key Insights**:
- **Landscape fragmentation** is highly predictive (heterogeneity metric)
- **Edge effects**: Clearings near other clearings have higher risk
- **Roads and infrastructure**: Captured in coarse-scale embeddings

**Why It Worked**: Deforestation is a spatial process. Areas near existing clearings, roads, and settlements have higher risk. Coarse-scale embeddings capture this context.

### Experiment 4: Temporal Generalization Testing (CRITICAL VALIDATION)

**Scripts**: `31_temporal_validation.py`, `48_temporal_validation_hard_sets.py`
**Docs**: `temporal_generalization_results.md`, `temporal_validation_plan.md`

**Question**: Does a model trained on 2020-2021 work on 2024?

**Motivation**: Real-world deployment requires generalization to future years.

**Method**:
```python
# Training: 2020-2021 data only (435 samples)
# Validation: Hard validation sets for 2022, 2023, 2024

train_years = [2020, 2021]
val_years = [2022, 2023, 2024]

model = train_model(train_years)
for year in val_years:
    metrics = evaluate(model, hard_val_sets[year])
```

**Results**: ✅ **EXCELLENT GENERALIZATION**

| Year | AUROC | Recall@0.5 | Precision@0.5 |
|------|-------|------------|---------------|
| 2022 | 0.91 | 82% | 79% |
| 2023 | 0.90 | 80% | 76% |
| 2024 | 0.89 | 78% | 74% |

**Key Insights**:
- **Stable performance** across 4-year gap!
- Slight degradation over time (expected drift)
- **No catastrophic failure** - model remains useful

**Why It Worked**: Using temporal deltas (year-over-year changes) makes the model robust to absolute embedding drift. Even if AlphaEarth's embeddings shift slightly over time, *changes* remain meaningful.

---

### Experiment 5: Fire Features Investigation (NEGATIVE RESULT)

**Scripts**: `01f_extract_fire_features.py`, `06_analyze_fire_results.py`, `07_test_modis_fire.py`
**Docs**: `fire_feature_investigation.md`, `logging_vs_fire_clarification.md`

**Hypothesis**: Incorporating active fire detections (MODIS/VIIRS) will improve deforestation prediction.

**Rationale**: Slash-and-burn agriculture involves fire. Fire detections might provide early warning signal.

**Method**:
```python
# Extract MODIS fire detections within 1km of each location
# Features:
fire_count_30d = count_fires(lat, lon, days=30)
fire_count_90d = count_fires(lat, lon, days=90)
fire_proximity = min_distance_to_fire(lat, lon)

# Train model with fire features
features_with_fire = [*annual_features, *multiscale_features, *fire_features]
```

**Results**: ❌ **NO IMPROVEMENT** (actually slight degradation!)

| Features | AUROC | Recall@0.5 |
|----------|-------|------------|
| Without fire | 0.89 | 78% |
| With fire | 0.87 | 76% |

**Analysis**: Why didn't fire features help?

1. **Temporal Mismatch**: Fire often occurs *after* clearing, not before
2. **False Positives**: Many fires unrelated to deforestation (agricultural burns, natural fires)
3. **Geographic Bias**: Fire patterns vary by region (slash-and-burn vs mechanical clearing)
4. **Logging vs Fire**: Project focuses on **logging deforestation**, not fire-based clearing (see `logging_vs_fire_clarification.md`)

**Key Learning**: *Domain knowledge matters*. Fire is not a universal deforestation precursor in commercial logging regions.

**Positive Outcome**: Thorough investigation documented in `fire_feature_investigation.md`. Saved future researchers from repeating this experiment.

---

### Experiment 6: Sentinel-2 Fine-Scale Features (NEGATIVE RESULT)

**Scripts**: `14_extract_sentinel2_features.py`, `15_train_xgboost_sentinel2.py`, `16_evaluate_sentinel2_model.py`
**Docs**: `debug_sentinel2.py`, `phase1_options_comparison.md`

**Hypothesis**: Combining 10m-resolution Sentinel-2 imagery with AlphaEarth embeddings will improve accuracy.

**Rationale**: AlphaEarth operates at coarse resolution (~10-30m). Sentinel-2 provides finer detail.

**Method**:
```python
# Extract Sentinel-2 spectral indices at 10m resolution:
ndvi = (NIR - RED) / (NIR + RED)
ndwi = (GREEN - NIR) / (GREEN + NIR)
nbr = (NIR - SWIR) / (NIR + SWIR)

# Features (130D total):
features = [
    *annual_features (3D),
    *multiscale_features (66D),
    *sentinel2_ndvi (20D),
    *sentinel2_ndwi (20D),
    *sentinel2_nbr (21D)
]
```

**Results**: ⚠️ **MARGINAL IMPROVEMENT, MAJOR COST**

| Features | AUROC | Latency |
|----------|-------|---------|
| AlphaEarth only (69D) | 0.89 | ~3 sec |
| + Sentinel-2 (130D) | 0.91 | ~45 sec |

**Cost-Benefit Analysis**:
- Performance improvement: +2 AUROC points
- Latency increase: **15x slower**
- Complexity: Much harder to cache/preprocess
- Cloud coverage: Sentinel-2 has gaps in cloudy regions

**Decision**: ❌ **NOT PRODUCTION-READY**
- Trade-off not worth it for +2 points
- AlphaEarth-only model sufficient for MVP

**Key Learning**: *Good enough is better than perfect*. The 69D model hits the sweet spot of performance vs complexity.

---

### Experiment 7: Spatial Leakage Discovery (CRITICAL INCIDENT)

**Scripts**: `18_fix_spatial_leakage.py`, `19_diagnose_perfect_cv.py`, `data_leakage_verification.py`
**Docs**: `spatial_leakage_incident_report.md`, `data_leakage_verification_results.md`

**Problem**: Cross-validation reported perfect 1.0 AUROC. Too good to be true.

**Investigation Timeline**:

**Day 1: Discovery**
```python
# Training: 847 samples, 5-fold CV
cv_scores = cross_validate(model, X, y, cv=5)
print(cv_scores)
# Output: [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]  # 🚨 RED FLAG!
```

**Day 2: Hypothesis - Spatial Leakage**

Spatial autocorrelation means nearby points are correlated. If train/val splits don't enforce spatial separation, validation samples may be "near neighbors" of training samples → leakage!

**Day 3: Verification**
```python
# Check minimum distance between train/val in each fold:
for fold in range(5):
    train_locs = get_locations(train_indices[fold])
    val_locs = get_locations(val_indices[fold])
    min_dist = compute_min_distance(train_locs, val_locs)
    print(f"Fold {fold}: min distance = {min_dist} km")

# Output:
# Fold 0: min distance = 0.03 km  # 30 meters!
# Fold 1: min distance = 0.05 km
# ...
```

**Root Cause**: Random k-fold split placed adjacent 10m pixels in train/val splits!

**Fix**: Implement spatial cross-validation:
```python
def spatial_cv_split(data, n_folds=5, min_distance_km=3):
    """
    Ensure train/val splits are separated by at least min_distance_km.
    """
    # Cluster locations into geographic regions
    clusters = cluster_locations(data, distance_threshold=min_distance_km)

    # Assign entire clusters to folds (not individual points)
    fold_assignments = assign_clusters_to_folds(clusters, n_folds)

    return fold_assignments
```

**Results After Fix**:

| Method | AUROC | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Random k-fold | 1.00 | ❌ Leakage |
| Spatial CV (3km separation) | 0.89 | ✅ Honest |
| Hard validation sets | 0.91 | ✅ Honest |

**Impact**:
- **Prevented catastrophic deployment failure**
- All subsequent experiments use spatial CV
- Hard validation sets designed with geographic diversity

**Key Learning**: *Always verify suspiciously good results*. Spatial data requires spatial validation strategies.

**Documentation**: Created detailed incident report (`spatial_leakage_incident_report.md`) and verification script (`data_leakage_verification.py`) for future reference.

### Experiment 9: Threshold Optimization (OPERATIONAL INSIGHT)

**Scripts**: `30_threshold_optimization.py`
**Docs**: `honest_performance_evaluation.md`

**Question**: What classification threshold to use in production?

**Method**: Analyze precision-recall trade-off across thresholds:

```python
thresholds = np.linspace(0, 1, 101)
for t in thresholds:
    y_pred = (probabilities >= t).astype(int)
    precision = precision_score(y_true, y_pred)
    recall = recall_score(y_true, y_pred)
    f1 = f1_score(y_true, y_pred)
```

**Results**:

| Threshold | Recall | Precision | F1 | Use Case |
|-----------|--------|-----------|-----|----------|
| 0.3 | 92% | 58% | 0.71 | High sensitivity (catch everything) |
| 0.5 | 78% | 74% | 0.76 | **Balanced (default)** |
| 0.7 | 61% | 86% | 0.71 | High precision (few false alarms) |

**Recommendation**: **Default to 0.5, allow user to adjust**

**Key Insight**: Different use cases need different thresholds:
- **Rapid response teams**: Lower threshold (0.3) - catch more events, tolerate false alarms
- **Long-term monitoring**: Balanced threshold (0.5)
- **Legal enforcement**: Higher threshold (0.7) - minimize false accusations

**Implementation**: Dashboard includes threshold slider (see RUN phase)

### Component 1: Model Service (`src/run/model_service.py`)

**Purpose**: Core inference engine

**Key Methods**:
```python
class DeforestationModelService:
    def extract_features_from_location(lat, lon, year) -> np.ndarray:
        """Extract 70D feature vector"""
        # Annual features (3D)
        annual = extract_dual_year_features(ee_client, sample)
        # Multiscale features (66D)
        multiscale = extract_multiscale_features(ee_client, sample)
        # Year feature (1D)
        year_norm = (year - 2020) / 4.0
        return np.concatenate([annual, multiscale, [year_norm]])

    def predict(lat, lon, year, threshold=0.5) -> dict:
        """Make prediction with confidence levels"""
        features = extract_features_from_location(lat, lon, year)
        prob = model.predict_proba([features])[0, 1]
        return {
            'risk_probability': prob,
            'predicted_class': int(prob >= threshold),
            'confidence': abs(prob - 0.5) * 2,
            'risk_category': categorize_risk(prob)
        }

    def explain_prediction(lat, lon, year, top_k=5) -> dict:
        """SHAP explanation for interpretability"""
        features = extract_features_from_location(lat, lon, year)
        explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(model)
        shap_values = explainer.shap_values([features])[0]
        # Return top-k contributing features
        return format_explanation(shap_values, feature_names, top_k)
```

**Performance**:
- Feature extraction: ~3 seconds (Earth Engine API calls)
- Prediction: <100ms (model inference)
- SHAP explanation: ~2 seconds
- **Total**: ~5 seconds per prediction

### Component 2: REST API (`src/run/api/main.py`)

## Key Lessons Learned

### 1. Start With Validation (CRAWL)
❌ **Don't**: Spend months building infrastructure before validating hypothesis
✅ **Do**: Run quick validation tests on 10-20 samples first

**Impact**: Saved weeks of potential wasted effort. Validated core hypothesis in days.

### 2. Document Everything
❌ **Don't**: Rely on memory or code comments
✅ **Do**: Create markdown docs for every experiment (even failed ones)

**Impact**: 47 docs created. Easy to reference past work, avoid repeating mistakes.

### 3. Hard Validation Sets Are Essential
❌ **Don't**: Trust random holdout sets
✅ **Do**: Create adversarial validation sets designed to catch overfitting

**Impact**: Spatial leakage discovered. Hard sets gave honest 0.91 AUROC vs inflated 1.0.

### 4. Negative Results Have Value
❌ **Don't**: Delete failed experiments
✅ **Do**: Document why they failed (fire features, Sentinel-2)

**Impact**: Future researchers won't waste time repeating failed approaches.

### 5. Simplicity Beats Complexity
❌ **Don't**: Add every possible feature
✅ **Do**: Find the simplest model that works

**Impact**: 70D model (simple) beats 130D model (complex + slow).

### 6. Context Matters (Multiscale)
❌ **Don't**: Treat each location independently
✅ **Do**: Include landscape context (neighboring areas)

**Impact**: Multiscale embeddings → +7 AUROC points.

### 7. Temporal Deltas > Absolute Values
❌ **Don't**: Use raw embeddings directly
✅ **Do**: Compute year-over-year changes

**Impact**: Single most important insight. Deltas capture change signal.

### 8. Verify Suspicious Results
❌ **Don't**: Celebrate perfect 1.0 AUROC immediately
✅ **Do**: Investigate why it's "too good"

**Impact**: Spatial leakage discovered, fixed before deployment.

### 9. Interpretability Enables Trust
❌ **Don't**: Deploy black box models
✅ **Do**: Provide SHAP explanations for every prediction

**Impact**: Users can understand *why* a location is high-risk.

### 10. Production is About Users
❌ **Don't**: Just train models
✅ **Do**: Build interfaces non-experts can use

**Impact**: Dashboard makes ML accessible to conservation teams without coding.

## What Didn't Work (And Why)

### 1. Fire Features ❌
**Tried**: MODIS/VIIRS fire detections
**Failed**: No performance improvement, actually degraded slightly
**Why**: Temporal mismatch (fire after clearing), false positives (agricultural burns), wrong deforestation type (logging vs slash-and-burn)
**Lesson**: Domain knowledge matters. Not all deforestation involves fire.
**Reference**: `fire_feature_investigation.md`

### 2. Sentinel-2 Fine-Scale Features ⚠️
**Tried**: 10m spectral indices (NDVI, NDWI, NBR)
**Result**: +2 AUROC points, but 15x slower
**Why**: Marginal benefit doesn't justify complexity and latency cost
**Lesson**: Good enough > perfect. 69D model is production-ready.
**Reference**: `phase1_options_comparison.md`

### 3. Edge Case Validation Sets ❌
**Tried**: Ultra-hard validation set with extreme edge cases
**Failed**: Empty dataset (too strict filtering)
**Why**: Filtering criteria too aggressive, no samples survived
**Lesson**: Even "hard" validation needs sufficient sample size
**Reference**: `hard_validation_sets_summary.md`

### 4. Random K-Fold Cross-Validation ❌
**Tried**: Standard scikit-learn cross_validate()
**Result**: Perfect 1.0 AUROC (suspicious!)
**Why**: Spatial leakage - adjacent pixels in train/val splits
**Fix**: Spatial CV with 3km minimum separation
**Lesson**: Spatial data requires spatial validation
**Reference**: `spatial_leakage_incident_report.md`

### 5. Single-Year Absolute Embeddings ❌
**Tried**: Use raw AlphaEarth embeddings as features
**Result**: Poor performance (0.62 AUROC)
**Why**: Embeddings encode state, not change. Deforestation is a change signal.
**Fix**: Use year-over-year deltas instead
**Lesson**: Feature engineering matters more than model architecture
**Reference**: `alphaearth_annual_embedding_correction.md`

### 6. Geographic Generalization (Initial Attempt) ⚠️
**Tried**: Deploy Amazon-trained model to Congo Basin
**Result**: Degraded performance (0.75 AUROC vs 0.91)
**Why**: Different forest types, cloud cover patterns, deforestation drivers
**Status**: Future work - requires regional fine-tuning
**Lesson**: Foundation models need adaptation for different domains
**Reference**: `geographic_test.py` (CRAWL phase)

## What Worked Exceptionally Well

### 1. Annual Temporal Features ⭐⭐⭐
**Why It Worked**: Captures change signal directly. Robust to embedding drift.
**Impact**: Foundation of entire system. 3D features → 0.82 AUROC alone.
**Key Insight**: `delta_1yr = ||emb(t) - emb(t-1)||` is the single most important feature.

### 2. Multiscale Embeddings ⭐⭐⭐
**Why It Worked**: Landscape context matters. Deforestation spreads spatially.
**Impact**: +7 AUROC points (0.82 → 0.89).
**Key Insight**: Coarse-scale heterogeneity captures edge effects and fragmentation.

### 3. Hard Validation Sets ⭐⭐⭐
**Why It Worked**: Honest evaluation catches overfitting. Adversarial design.
**Impact**: Prevented deployment of overfit models. True performance estimates.
**Key Insight**: Easy validation sets give false confidence.

### 4. SHAP Explanations ⭐⭐
**Why It Worked**: Users trust what they understand. Interpretability enables adoption.
**Impact**: Conservation teams can verify predictions before taking action.
**Key Insight**: Black box models won't be deployed in high-stakes domains.

### 5. Spatial Cross-Validation ⭐⭐
**Why It Worked**: Prevents spatial leakage. Honest generalization estimates.
**Impact**: Caught 1.0 AUROC → 0.89 AUROC (true performance).
**Key Insight**: Geographic data requires geographic validation.

### 6. Pre-extracted Features (Dashboard Optimization) ⭐⭐
**Why It Worked**: Avoids slow Earth Engine API calls during interactive use.
**Impact**: 10+ minutes → <1 second dashboard load time.
**Key Insight**: User experience matters. Pre-computation enables interactivity.

### 7. CRAWL → WALK → RUN Methodology ⭐⭐⭐
**Why It Worked**: Risk mitigation. Validate before building. Learn before deploying.
**Impact**: No wasted effort. Each phase built on validated learnings.
**Key Insight**: Disciplined process beats ad-hoc experimentation.

### 8. Comprehensive Documentation ⭐⭐
**Why It Worked**: Makes research reproducible. Negative results documented.
**Impact**: 47 docs, 81 scripts - complete research trail.
**Key Insight**: Future researchers can build on this work without repeating mistakes.
