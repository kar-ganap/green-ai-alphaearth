## Detailed Analysis

### Option A: Scale to 120+ Samples

#### What It Is
Simply increase the sample size from 24 to 120 clearings:
```bash
uv run python src/temporal_investigation/phase1_glad_validation.py --n-samples 120
```

#### Expected Quarterly Distribution (Based on Q3 Dominance)

**Current distribution with 24 samples:**
- Q1: 1 (7.7%)
- Q2: 2 (15.4%)
- Q3: 8 (61.5%)
- Q4: 2 (15.4%)

**Projected distribution with 120 samples:**
- Q1: ~9-10 samples (7.7% × 120)
- Q2: ~18-20 samples (15.4% × 120)
- Q3: ~74 samples (61.5% × 120)
- Q4: ~18-20 samples (15.4% × 120)

**BUT**: We only enriched 13/24 (54%) with GLAD dates, so:
- Q1: ~5-6 samples with dates
- Q2: ~10-11 samples
- Q3: ~40 samples
- Q4: ~10-11 samples

**Problem**: Still might not get ≥3 Q1 samples!

**Better approach**: **Stratified sampling** - deliberately oversample Q1/Q4 periods.

#### How to Improve Option A: Stratified Temporal Sampling

Instead of random sampling across all 3 years, we can:

1. **Get MORE clearings per year** (say, 60 per year × 3 years = 180 total)
2. **GLAD will naturally filter** to ~97 clearings (54% success rate)
3. **Expected quarterly distribution**:
   - Q1: ~7-8 samples ✅
   - Q2: ~15 samples ✅
   - Q3: ~60 samples ✅
   - Q4: ~15 samples ✅

**Command**:
```bash
uv run python src/temporal_investigation/phase1_glad_validation.py --n-samples 180
```

**Time**: ~45-60 minutes (GLAD queries are slow)

#### Pros ✅

1. **Clean methodology**: Standard approach (stratify by outcome timing)
2. **Already implemented**: Just change `--n-samples 180`
3. **High confidence results**: Large sample sizes reduce noise
4. **Addresses root cause**: Insufficient samples due to natural seasonality
5. **Publishable**: No need to justify alternative approaches
6. **Can run while you do other work**: Fire and forget

#### Cons ❌

1. **Takes compute time**: 45-60 minutes (but you can multitask)
2. **Still small risk of insufficient Q1**: If deforestation is <5% in Q1
3. **Uses more Earth Engine quota**: 180 × 2 embeddings = 360 API calls

#### Risk Assessment

**What could go wrong?**

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Still insufficient Q1 samples (< 3) | Low (~10%) | High | Go to 240 samples if needed |
| GLAD enrichment rate drops | Low | Medium | We already validated 54% rate |
| Earth Engine quota exceeded | Very Low | Low | Takes ~360 API calls, quota is 10k+ |
| Takes longer than 60 min | Medium | Low | Can run overnight if needed |

### Option B: Alternative Validation Approaches

#### Approach B1: Month-Level Comparison

**Hypothesis**: Compare early months (Jan-Mar) vs late months (Oct-Dec)

**Current data available**:
- We have 13 clearings with GLAD dates
- Each has `month` field (1-12)
- Can group into early (1-3) vs late (10-12) months

**Expected distribution**:
```
Jan: 0-1 samples
Feb: 0-1 samples
Mar: 0-1 samples
---
Early months total: 1-2 samples ❌ Still insufficient!

Oct: 0-1 samples
Nov: 0-1 samples
Dec: 0-1 samples
---
Late months total: 1-2 samples ❌ Still insufficient!
```

**Problem**: Granularity doesn't help when we have so few samples outside Q3!

**Verdict**: ❌ **Won't work with current data**

---

#### Approach B2: Half-Year Comparison

**Hypothesis**: Compare H1 (Jan-Jun) vs H2 (Jul-Dec)

**Expected distribution**:
- H1 (Q1 + Q2): 1 + 2 = 3 samples ⚠️ Borderline
- H2 (Q3 + Q4): 8 + 2 = 10 samples ✅ Good

**Analysis approach**:
```python
# Get embeddings at Y-1 mid-year
h1_clearings = [c for c in clearings if c['month'] <= 6]
h2_clearings = [c for c in clearings if c['month'] > 6]

# Test if Y-1 embedding predicts H2 better than H1
# If H2 distance >> H1 distance: Precursor signal
```

**Pros**:
- ✅ Might barely work with 3 H1 samples (minimum for t-test)
- ✅ Uses existing data
- ✅ Fast implementation (~30 min coding)

**Cons**:
- ❌ Low statistical power (n=3 is minimum)
- ❌ Mixed signal: H1 includes Q2 (mid-year), H2 includes Q3 (peak season)
- ❌ Less interpretable than Q1 vs Q4
- ❌ Need to justify why half-year makes sense

**Verdict**: ⚠️ **Technically possible but weak**

---

#### Approach B3: Baseline Comparison (Q3 Only)

**Hypothesis**: Compare Q3 to a theoretical baseline

**Current data**: 8 Q3 clearings with strong signal (p < 0.0001)

**Test 1: Compare to Random Baseline**
```python
# Null hypothesis: Y-1 embedding doesn't predict Y clearing
# Alternative: Y-1 distance > 0

# Current result: mean distance = 0.639, p < 0.0001
# Conclusion: ✅ Definitely predicts SOMETHING

# But we don't know if it's:
# - Precursor (preparation in Y-1)
# - Early detection (Q1-Q2 clearing captured in annual)
# - Both
```

**Problem**: Doesn't distinguish precursor from early detection!

**Test 2: Compare Q3 to Natural Drift**
```python
# Get embeddings for intact forest locations
# Measure Y-1 to Y distance for non-cleared areas
# Compare: cleared Q3 distance vs intact distance

# If cleared >> intact: Clearing signal present
# But still doesn't tell us WHEN the signal appeared
```

**Problem**: Still doesn't answer precursor question!

**Verdict**: ❌ **Doesn't solve our problem**

---

#### Approach B4: Use ALL Quarters in Mixed Model

**Hypothesis**: Model quarterly variation with what we have

**Approach**:
```python
# For each clearing with GLAD date:
quarters = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]  # Our distribution
distances = [0.51, 0.62, 0.59, 0.68, 0.71, ...]      # Y-1 to Y distances

# Fit a simple model:
# distance ~ quarter + error

# Test if quarter matters
# If significant: Temporal pattern exists
```

**Statistical approach**: Linear regression or ANOVA

**Pros**:
- ✅ Uses all 13 samples (maximizes power)
- ✅ Can detect overall quarterly trend
- ✅ Established statistical method

**Cons**:
- ❌ Imbalanced design (8 Q3, 1-2 others)
- ❌ Low power for Q1/Q4 comparison (our primary question)
- ❌ Assumes linear relationship
- ❌ Doesn't directly test "Q4 > Q1" hypothesis

**Verdict**: ⚠️ **Interesting but indirect**

---

## The Core Problem with Option B

**All alternative approaches suffer from the same issue**: We only have **13 clearings with GLAD dates**, and they're heavily skewed to Q3.

**No amount of clever analysis can create data that doesn't exist.**

The alternatives either:
1. **Don't answer the precursor question** (B3)
2. **Have insufficient power** (B1, B2)
3. **Answer a different question** (B4)

## Side-by-Side: What Each Option Tells Us

### Scenario 1: Q4 Distance > Q1 Distance

| Option | Result | Interpretation |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **A: Q1 vs Q4** | Q4 mean = 0.85, Q1 mean = 0.62, p = 0.03 | ✅ **Strong precursor signal**: Y-1 embedding captures preparation (roads, camps) that precede late-year clearing |
| **B2: H1 vs H2** | H2 mean = 0.75, H1 mean = 0.60, p = 0.12 | ⚠️ **Suggestive but not significant**: Might be precursor, might be chance |
| **B4: Quarterly model** | Quarter effect p = 0.08 | ⚠️ **Marginal significance**: Some temporal pattern, but unclear |

### Scenario 2: Q1 Distance ≈ Q4 Distance

| Option | Result | Interpretation |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **A: Q1 vs Q4** | Q4 mean = 0.68, Q1 mean = 0.66, p = 0.78 | ✅ **Clear answer: Mixed signal** - Both precursor and early detection present |
| **B2: H1 vs H2** | H2 mean = 0.70, H1 mean = 0.64, p = 0.45 | ❓ **Unclear**: Is this mixed signal or insufficient power? |
| **B4: Quarterly model** | Quarter effect p = 0.35 | ❓ **No effect detected**: But is this real or underpowered? |

**Key difference**: Option A gives **definitive answers**, Option B leaves uncertainty.

# 2. Wait 45-60 minutes (can do other work)

# 3. Read results (5 minutes)
cat results/temporal_investigation/phase1_glad_validation.json

# 4. Interpret (10 minutes)
# - Q4 > Q1: Precursor signal ✓
# - Q1 > Q4: Early detection ✗
# - Similar: Mixed signal ~

# Total active time: 20 minutes
# Total wall time: 60 minutes
```

### Option B2 (Best Alternative): Step-by-Step
```bash
# 1. Implement half-year analysis (30-45 min coding)
# - Modify phase1_glad_validation.py
# - Add H1/H2 stratification logic
# - Update interpretation criteria

# 2. Run analysis (5 minutes)
uv run python src/temporal_investigation/phase1_glad_validation_halfyear.py

# 3. Interpret results (20 minutes)
# - H2 > H1 by how much?
# - Is p-value < 0.05 with n=3 H1 samples?
# - What does this mean for precursor signal?
# - How to explain why half-year vs quarterly?

# 4. Write justification (30 minutes)
# - Why we chose half-year split
# - Why this is scientifically valid
# - Limitations of small sample size

# Total active time: 90 minutes
# Total wall time: 90 minutes
```

## Recommendation Matrix

### If You Value...

| Priority | Choose | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| **Scientific rigor** | A | Standard methodology, no need to justify |
| **Speed to result** | A | Just run a command, 20 min active work |
| **Clear interpretation** | A | Q4 vs Q1 is intuitive and direct |
| **Publishability** | A | Standard stratification approach |
| **Minimizing compute** | B | Uses existing 13 samples |
| **Learning/exploration** | B | Opportunity to try creative approaches |

### If Your Constraints Are...

| Constraint | Choose | Why |
|------------|--------|-----|
| "Need answer today" | A | Faster active time (20 min vs 90 min) |
| "Can't wait 60 min" | B | But results will be weaker |
| "Must minimize Earth Engine calls" | B | Uses 13 samples vs 180 |
| "Want definitive answer" | A | High statistical power |
| "Okay with ambiguity" | B | May still be inconclusive |

---

## My Strong Recommendation: **Option A with 180 Samples**

**Three reasons:**

### 1. **Option B Likely Still Inconclusive**

With only 1-3 samples in early months, even half-year comparison (B2) will have:
- Low statistical power (n=3 for H1)
- Wide confidence intervals
- Risk of false negatives ("no effect" when there is one)
- Risk of false positives (spurious significance)

**You'll likely end up running Option A anyway.**

### 2. **Option A Addresses Root Cause**

The problem isn't our analysis approach—it's insufficient data. Option B is trying to squeeze signal from noise.

**Better to get more data than try to over-analyze limited data.**

### 3. **Option A Is Actually Faster**

| | Option A | Option B2 |
|---|---|---|
| Your active time | 20 min | 90 min |
| Compute time | 60 min (background) | 5 min |
| **Total your time** | **20 min** | **90 min** |

**You can start Option A right now, go get coffee, and have results when you return.**

## Action Plan: Go with Option A

### Immediate (Right Now)
```bash
# Start the run
uv run python src/temporal_investigation/phase1_glad_validation.py --n-samples 180 \
    2>&1 | tee /tmp/phase1_glad_validation_180samples.txt
```

### While It Runs (45-60 minutes)
- Get coffee ☕
- Read a paper 📄
- Take a walk 🚶
- Work on something else

### When Complete
1. Check results: `cat results/temporal_investigation/phase1_glad_validation.json`
2. Interpret:
   - Q4 > Q1? → Precursor signal → Proceed to WALK phase
   - Q1 > Q4? → Early detection → Reframe project
   - Similar? → Mixed signal → Proceed with honest framing
3. Update documentation
4. **Move forward with confidence**

## Conclusion

**Option A is superior in every meaningful way:**
- ✅ More rigorous
- ✅ Faster (in active time)
- ✅ Clearer interpretation
- ✅ Lower risk of remaining inconclusive
- ✅ Already implemented (just change one parameter)

**Option B alternatives:**
- ⚠️ Require more work from you
- ⚠️ Likely still inconclusive
- ⚠️ Harder to interpret/publish
- ⚠️ Don't solve the fundamental problem (insufficient data)

**My recommendation: Run Option A with `--n-samples 180` right now.** ⭐

You'll have your answer in an hour and can move forward confidently.
