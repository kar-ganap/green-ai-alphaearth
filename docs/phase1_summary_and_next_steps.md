# Phase 1: Summary & Next Steps

**Date**: 2025-10-18
**Status**: Bug fixed, annual features corrected, multiscale features ready

---

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Discovered and Fixed Critical Bug ✓

**Bug**: Quarterly feature extraction was requesting Q1-Q4 embeddings, but AlphaEarth returns the SAME annual embedding for any date within a year.

**Impact**:
- Created 17 "features" that were actually 1 unique value replicated
- Perfect collinearity (correlation = 1.0)
- Invalidated Phase 1 experiment results

**Fix**: Replaced buggy 17D quarterly features with honest 3D annual features:
```python
delta_1yr = ||emb(Y) - emb(Y-1)||      # Recent annual change
delta_2yr = ||emb(Y-1) - emb(Y-2)||    # Historical annual change
acceleration = delta_1yr - delta_2yr    # Change acceleration
```

### 2. Re-Ran Phase 1 with Corrected Features ✓

**Training Data**: 589 samples (300 clearing, 289 intact)
**Features**: 3D annual (corrected)
**Success Rate**: 98.2%

**Results**:

| Validation Set | Buggy 17D | Corrected 3D | Baseline | Target |
|----------------|-----------|--------------|----------|--------|
| risk_ranking | 0.838 | **0.825** | 0.850 | — |
| rapid_response | 0.824 | **0.786** | 0.824 | — |
| comprehensive | 0.756 | **0.747** | 0.758 | — |
| edge_cases | 0.567 | **0.533** | 0.583 | **0.70** |

**Finding**: Corrected model performs similarly to buggy model (both underperform).

### 3. Identified The Real Gap ✓

**Critical Observation**: Temporal Generalization (0.971) >>> Phase 1 (0.533-0.825)

| Scenario | ROC-AUC | Difference |
|----------|---------|------------|
| **Temporal Generalization** (same geography, future year) | **0.971** | Baseline |
| **Phase 1 - standard sets** (different geography) | 0.747-0.825 | **-15 to -23%** |
| **Phase 1 - edge cases** (different geography + hard) | 0.533 | **-45%** |

**Why the gap?**
1. **Geographic shift**: Different regions have different land cover patterns
2. **Scenario complexity**: Edge cases (small <1ha, fire-prone, fragmented)
3. **Insufficient features**: Only 3 annual deltas can't capture spatial/contextual info

### 4. Prepared Multiscale Features ✓

**Extracted for validation sets**:
- edge_cases: 22 samples, 80 features each
- risk_ranking: 43 samples, 80 features each
- comprehensive: 70 samples, 80 features each

**Feature breakdown (80D)**:
- Fine-scale (Sentinel-2 10m): 14 features
  - Spectral bands: B2-B8A, B11-B12
  - Indices: NDVI, NBR, EVI, NDWI
- Coarse-scale (landscape 100m): 66 features
  - 64D average embedding from 3×3 grid
  - Heterogeneity, range metrics

**Combined**: 3D annual + 80D multiscale = **83D total**

## Key Insights

### Detection vs Prediction (Confirmed)

Based on temporal investigation (docs/temporal_investigation_findings.md):

**AlphaEarth CAN** (0-3 month lag):
- ✓ Detect year-of-clearing (concurrent detection)
- ✓ Distinguish fire-based (0.71 signal) from logging-based (0.46 signal)
- ✓ Annual resolution matches data source capability

**AlphaEarth CANNOT** (4-6+ month lead):
- ✗ Predict deforestation months in advance (Q4 test: p=0.065, not significant)
- ✗ Provide quarterly resolution (returns same embedding within year)

**Honest framing**: This is a **DETECTION system** (0-12 month lag), not **PREDICTION** (4-6 month lead).

### Your Original Control Logic Was Sound

You correctly identified that:
```
emb(Y-1) vs emb(Y) comparison = "control model"
- If agree (small delta) → Clearing hasn't occurred yet
- If disagree (large delta) → Clearing occurred in year Y
```

This logic is **correct for detection**, just not for long-term prediction.

**Why temporal gen works (0.97)**: Same geography, the delta feature is powerful for detecting when clearing occurred.

**Why Phase 1 struggles (0.53-0.83)**: Different geography + edge cases need more than just annual deltas.

## Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Add Multiscale Features (Recommended)

**Status**: Validation sets ready, training set needs extraction

**Steps**:
1. Extract multiscale features for Phase 1 training set (600 samples)
   - ~30-60 minutes with Earth Engine
2. Train model combining 3D annual + 80D multiscale = 83D
3. Evaluate on validation sets
4. **Expected**: 0.70-0.80 ROC-AUC on edge cases (closing ~50% of gap)

**Pros**:
- Validation sets already have features extracted
- Addresses spatial context and small-scale detection
- Single unified model

**Cons**:
- Need to extract for 600 training samples (~30-60 min)
- May still underperform on hardest edge cases

### Option 2: Build Specialized Models (Phase 2)

**Status**: Can implement immediately with current features

**Steps**:
1. Split into 2 models:
   - Standard model: For normal clearings (temporal gen shows 0.97 works)
   - Edge case model: With annual + multiscale + contextual features
2. Simple routing: `if size < 1ha OR fire_prone: use edge_model`
3. Train each on ~300-400 samples

**Pros**:
- Targeted approach for different scenarios
- Standard cases already work well (0.97)
- Can optimize each model separately

**Cons**:
- More complex system (2 models + routing)
- Need to maintain both models
- Routing logic needs validation

### Option 3: Accept Detection Framing & Deploy

**Status**: Can deploy immediately with corrected 3D model

**Steps**:
1. Accept 0.75-0.83 performance on most sets
2. Use edge_cases (0.53) as indicator of known limitation
3. Focus on standard clearings (where we have 0.97 temporal gen)
4. Frame as "concurrent detection" not "prediction"

**Pros**:
- Immediate deployment
- Honest about capabilities
- Still 2-5x faster than optical satellites

**Cons**:
- Misses hardest edge cases
- Lower performance than ideal
- Target (0.70 on edge cases) not met

## My Recommendation

**Start with Option 1 (Multiscale Features)**

**Reasoning**:
1. Validation sets already have multiscale features (80D)
2. Only need to extract for 600 training samples (~30-60 min)
3. Single unified model simpler than Option 2
4. Likely to get 0.70-0.80 on edge cases (meets target)
5. If still underperforms, can proceed to Option 2

**Execution Plan**:
1. Run `src/walk/09a_extract_multiscale_for_training.py` (I created this)
2. Create training script combining 3D + 80D features
3. Train and evaluate
4. If edge_cases < 0.70: Add contextual features (roads, fire) or go to Option 2

**Expected Timeline**: 1-2 hours total

## Questions for Discussion

1. **Framing**: Are you comfortable with "detection" (0-12 month lag) vs "prediction" (4-6 month lead) framing?

2. **GLAD-S2 quarterly labels**: You mentioned fire-related deforestation detection. With annual resolution, we can:
   - Detect when clearing occurred in year Y
   - Use GLAD-S2 to determine IF it was fire-related (quarterly labels)
   - This is classification/attribution, not prediction
   - Is this acceptable for your use case?

3. **Next step**: Should we proceed with Option 1 (multiscale features)?

4. **Long-term value**: Given no evidence of precursors (Q4 test failed), is concurrent detection (0-12 month lag) still valuable?
   - 2-5× faster than optical satellites (cloud penetration)
   - Annual decision-making timelines for enforcement
   - Rapid response to GLAD-S2 quarterly alerts

---

## Bottom Line

**The Bug Fix Was Essential**: We now have honest annual features that match AlphaEarth's capability.

**The Gap Is Real**: Temporal gen (0.97) proves the approach works. Phase 1 gap (0.53-0.83) is due to geographic shift + scenario complexity.

**Path Forward**: Add multiscale features to bridge the gap. If that's insufficient, specialize with Phase 2.

**Honest Framing**: This is a cloud-penetrating concurrent detection system (0-12 month lag), not long-term prediction (4-6 month lead). Still valuable for rapid response.
