# Repository Cleanup Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-24
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

---

## Overview

This document summarizes the repository cleanup performed to improve organization, reduce technical debt, and prepare the codebase for transfer learning and future development.

---

## Actions Taken

### 1. Log File Organization ✅

**Problem**: 34 log files cluttering the project root directory

**Action**: Moved all log files to `logs/` directory

```bash
mv *.log logs/
```

**Result**:
- ✅ 34 log files moved to `logs/`
- ✅ Clean project root directory
- ✅ Improved professional appearance

**Files Moved**:
- `uniform_30pct_collection*.log` (training data collection)
- `hard_val_collection_*.log` (validation set creation)
- `hard_val_feature_extraction*.log` (feature extraction runs)
- `temporal_validation_results*.log` (temporal validation experiments)
- `model_ensemble_results.log` (ensemble experiments)
- `final_models_2020_2024_results.log` (final model training)

---

### 2. Data File Manifest Creation ✅

**Problem**: 118 pickle files with no tracking system, unclear which are production vs experimental

**Action**: Created comprehensive `data/processed/MANIFEST.md`

**Features**:
- Categorizes all 118 pickle files by status (Production, Experimental, Old)
- Identifies 13 critical production files
- Marks ~85 old files for deletion
- Provides cleanup commands for immediate execution
- Documents file naming conventions
- Tracks file sizes and purposes

**Key Classifications**:

| Category | Count | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Production Models | 3 | KEEP (final_*_model_2020_2024.pkl) |
| Production Validation Sets (with features) | 9 | KEEP (hard_val_*_features.pkl) |
| Production Training Data | 1 | KEEP (walk_dataset.pkl) |
| Base Validation Sets (no features) | 9 | ARCHIVE |
| Failed Edge Cases | ~15 | DELETE (5 byte files) |
| Old Validation Versions | ~70 | DELETE (superseded) |
| Experimental Features | ~10 | ARCHIVE |

**Production Files Identified** (13 files - 11 GB):
```
final_xgb_model_2020_2024.pkl          # XGBoost model (0.913 AUROC)
final_rf_model_2020_2024.pkl           # Random Forest model

walk_dataset.pkl                        # Current training dataset
```

---

### 3. Archive Directory Structure ✅

**Action**: Created organized archive structure

```
data/processed/archive/
├── experiments/          # Multi-scale, Sentinel-2, fire features (2.0 MB)
├── old_models/           # Old model versions (2.6 MB)
├── training_data/        # Old training dataset versions (9.2 MB)
└── validation_base/      # Base validation sets (without features) (44 KB)
```

**Purpose**:
- Preserve research artifacts without cluttering main directory
- Enable future reproducibility
- Clear separation between production and experimental data

---

### 4. File Cleanup Execution ✅

**Status**: **COMPLETED** on 2025-10-24

**Actions Executed**:

1. **Deleted Failed Files** (31 files, ~200 KB)
   - 14 failed edge case files (5 bytes each - empty)
   - 17 old validation versions from early Oct 23

2. **Archived Experimental Files** (57 files, ~13.8 MB)
   - 9 experimental feature files → `experiments/`
   - 8 old model versions → `old_models/`
   - 29 old training data versions → `training_data/`
   - 11 base validation sets → `validation_base/`

**Results**:
- **Before**: 118 pickle files in main directory
- **After**: 33 production files in main directory
- **Space organized**: 13.8 MB moved to archive
- **Disk space freed**: ~200 KB deleted

**Git Commit**: `031020b` - "Clean up data/processed directory"

## Codebase Audit Findings

### Good ✅

1. **Documentation** (48 markdown files)
   - Excellent coverage of all experiments
   - Each phase well-documented (CRAWL, WALK, RUN)
   - Comprehensive user guides and architecture docs

2. **Configuration Management**
   - Clean YAML-based config with dot notation
   - Smart path resolution
   - Default values and validation

3. **Utilities** (6 modules)
   - Well-organized utility functions
   - Earth Engine client with smart caching
   - Reusable visualization and geo utilities

4. **Production Code** (src/run/)
   - Clean separation of concerns
   - FastAPI with auto-docs
   - Streamlit dashboard with 5 pages
   - SHAP explanations
   - Proper error handling

### Bad ⚠️

1. **Script Organization** (81 numbered scripts in src/walk/)
   - Sequential numbering: 01_ through 52_
   - Version duplication: _v2, _v3 variants
   - Parallel approaches: 31_, 31b_, 31c_
   - Mixed concerns: helpers alongside numbered scripts

2. **Code Duplication**
   - 17 different `extract_features` functions
   - Identical code in `annual_features.py` and `diagnostic_helpers.py`
   - No single source of truth for feature extraction

3. **Data Management**
   - 118 pickle files with no manifest (now fixed!)
   - Timestamp-based naming makes current version unclear
   - Backups mixed with active data

### Ugly 🚨

1. **Feature Extraction Duplication** ✅ **RESOLVED**
   - **Was**: 17 implementations with inconsistent signatures
   - **Now**: Single canonical module `src/walk/utils/feature_extraction.py`
   - 33 scripts migrated to use consolidated code
   - 100% verification pass on 125 samples
   - **Git Commits**: `1cf6418`, `40a061c` on `cleanup/refactor-codebase` branch

2. **Versioning Hell** (Optional - Low Priority)
   - Multiple _v2, _v3, _v4, _v5, _v6 versions
   - No indication of which is current
   - **Recommendation**: Delete old versions, keep latest only (can live with current state)

3. **Failed Data Collection** ✅ **RESOLVED**
   - **Was**: 15+ edge case files with 5 bytes (empty)
   - **Now**: All 14 failed edge case files deleted
   - **Git Commit**: `031020b` on `cleanup/refactor-codebase` branch

## Recommendations for Future Work

### Immediate (Do Next) ✅ **COMPLETED**

1. ✅ **Execute cleanup commands** from MANIFEST.md
   - ✅ Deleted 31 old/failed files
   - ✅ Moved 57 experimental files to archive
   - ✅ Reclaimed ~200 KB, organized 13.8 MB

2. ✅ **Consolidate feature extraction**
   - ✅ Created single canonical `src/walk/utils/feature_extraction.py`
   - ✅ Moved all feature extraction logic there
   - ✅ Updated 33 scripts to use consolidated module
   - ✅ Verified 100% correctness on 125 samples

3. **Document current workflow** (Optional)
   - Which scripts are production-ready?
   - Which are experimental?
   - Create execution order document

### Short-term (This Sprint)

1. **Refactor src/walk/** into functional modules:
   ```
   src/walk/
   ├── utils/
   │   ├── feature_extraction.py  # Canonical feature extraction
   │   ├── data_collection.py     # Sample collection utilities
   │   └── validation.py          # Validation set utilities
   ├── data_preparation/
   │   ├── collect_samples.py
   │   ├── extract_features.py
   │   └── create_validation_sets.py
   ├── models/
   │   ├── train_xgboost.py
   │   ├── train_random_forest.py
   │   └── ensemble.py
   ├── validation/

   - `docs/experiment_guide.md` - How to run experiments

3. **Add integration tests**
   - Test feature extraction consistency
   - Test model training pipeline
   - Test validation set creation

### Medium-term (Next Sprint)

1. **Training pipeline automation**
   - Single script to train from scratch

   - Built-in validation

2. **Docker support**
   - Dockerfile for reproducibility
   - Docker Compose for API + Dashboard
   - Earth Engine authentication handling

3. **Data versioning**
   - DVC (Data Version Control) integration
   - Automatic manifest updates
   - Track data lineage

### Long-term (Future Phases)

1. **Convert to Python package**
   - Proper `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml`
   - Installable with `pip install -e .`
   - CLI tools for common operations

2. **MLOps Integration**
   - MLflow for experiment tracking
   - Automated model registry
   - CI/CD pipeline for retraining

3. **Monitoring & Observability**
   - Prometheus metrics
   - Grafana dashboards
   - Data drift detection
